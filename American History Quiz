# In the section shown below, we greet the user and inform them about the quiz. I've built-in options to allow the
# user to exit the program if they wish not to play. In addition to that, I also wrote the program to accept multiple
# types of input. Various forms of text input will be standard throughout the remainder of the program.

# One thing you will note here is that I added a time delay between prompts. The time delays are added to give the
# quiz a unique look and feel. The time delays allow the user to read the text naturally instead of forced.

# The section shown above establishes the quiz score and the question numbers. These will be used as a running total
# throughout the program as the user progresses.

# Next, we define the two primary functions of the quiz. The first is correct_answer, and this is the function that
# will run if the user inputs the correct answer when they are answering the quiz question. If the answer is True the
# function appends quiz_score and question_number with +1. Additionally, it concludes with printing text to inform
# the quiz taker that their question was correct and tells them their current score.

# I’ve applied the same logic to the incorrect_answer function. The only difference between the incorrect_answer
# function and the correct_answer function is that the incorrect_answer function does not append the quiz score and
# informs the quiz taker that their answer was incorrect.

# From here, the quiz taker moves on to answering the questions. We print the question then prompt the user for
# input. If the user correctly answers then, we run our correct_answer function. If the answer is incorrect,
# then we run our incorrect_answer function. The correct answer_function and incorrect answer function is applied to
# all questions, including the True/False question.
